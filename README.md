## Description

Roadrunner is an application that brings distributors and trucking companies together. It allows distributors to post loads to the app's "Load Board" component, where dispatchers (app users who represent a trucking company) can then visit that Load Board and place bids on any loads they want. Distributors have full control over what bids they want to accept, and once a bid is accepted, dispatchers are responsible for keeping that load updated for the distributor, and making sure it gets picked up and delivered on time.

I used to work in logistics as the middle-man between distributors and trucking companies. And while there were many aspects of the job that I did enjoy, there was an equal counter-part of dislikes. I believe those feelings and experiences sparked my motivation to build Roadrunner, which takes the place of the middle-man I described above.

I built this application in a two-week sprint using JavaScript with the React framework for the front-end, alongside Python and the Django REST framework for the back-end. One of my goals was to gain a better understanding of server-side fundamentals while focusing on optimization, organization, and scalability. One of the things I really noticed while building my first full-stack web application was how much of the client-side code can become obsolete once you understand how powerful back-end frameworks, like Django, can be!
